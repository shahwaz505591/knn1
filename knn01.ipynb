    "Q1: Difference Between Euclidean and Manhattan Distance in KNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean Distance: It calculates the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space, considering both horizontal and vertical movements. In KNN, it can capture the shortest path between data points in a continuous space.\n",
    "Manhattan Distance: Also known as \"taxicab\" or \"city block\" distance, it measures the distance as the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates. In KNN, it calculates the distance by adding up the horizontal and vertical distances between data points along the grid.\n",
    "The main difference between them is the way they account for the direction and manner in which data points are related. Euclidean distance tends to consider diagonal movements, while Manhattan distance restricts movement to orthogonal directions (horizontal and vertical). The choice between them depends on the nature of the data and the problem. Using Euclidean distance can be more sensitive to outliers and the scale of the features, while Manhattan distance is less influenced by such factors. The choice of distance metric can affect the KNN model's performance, so it's important to experiment with both to determine which one works better for a specific problem."

    "Q2: Choosing the Optimal Value of K:\n",
    "Selecting the optimal value of K in KNN is a critical task. Common techniques to determine the optimal K value include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Perform k-fold cross-validation and choose the K value that results in the best model performance (e.g., accuracy, mean squared error) on the validation sets.\n",
    "Grid Search: Test a range of K values and evaluate the model using a validation dataset. Choose the K that yields the best performance.\n",
    "Elbow Method: Plot the model's performance (e.g., accuracy or error) against different K values. Look for the point where the performance starts to stabilize or \"bend,\" indicating an optimal K value.\n",
    "Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV): Compute the performance for a range of K values by leaving out one data point at a time. The K value with the lowest average error can be chosen."

    "Q3: Effect of Distance Metric on KNN Performance:\n",
    "The choice of distance metric in KNN can significantly affect model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean Distance: It's suitable when you want to consider both magnitude and direction of differences between data points in a continuous space. It's sensitive to the scale and outliers in the data.\n",
    "Manhattan Distance: It's more suitable when you want to focus on differences along orthogonal directions. It's less sensitive to outliers and feature scaling issues.\n",
    "The selection of the distance metric depends on the specific problem and the characteristics of the data. For example, if features have different units or scales, Manhattan distance may be a better choice. Euclidean distance might work well when the data naturally exists in a continuous space and when outliers are not a significant concern."

    "The size of the training set can significantly impact KNN's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Small Training Set: When the training set is small, KNN is more prone to overfitting, as there may not be enough representative examples for each class or region in the feature space.\n",
    "Large Training Set: A larger training set provides more information and can lead to a more stable and generalizable model. However, it can also increase computation time.\n",
    "To optimize the size of the training set, you can use techniques like resampling, bootstrapping, or cross-validation to ensure that the model has sufficient data to learn from without overfitting."
